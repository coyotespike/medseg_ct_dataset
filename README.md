# medseg_ct_dataset

The [MedSeg team](http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/) created this dataset by processing images from an [open-access collection of cases](https://www.sirm.org/en/).

This is great of them because the images are not available for easy download. I assume they downloaded each image individually.

- dataset/tr_im.nii are the training images
- dataset/tr_mask are the training masks
- dataset/val_im are the test images
